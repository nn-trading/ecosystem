- reports/actions_2025111@_ 150309.json

Verification:

- Screenshot exists: C:\bots\ecosys\reports\screens\ecosystem_ready2.png (timestamp ~15:04)
- Action log parsed; flow succeeded (open notepad, type, save, screenshot, close).

- Text file now present and committed.

Task tracker updates:

- t11: Run ecosys_goal.ps1 with updated save path and screenshot — done
- t12: Verify ECOSYSTEM_READY.txt content and screenshot file — done

- t13: Create ECOSYSTEM_READY.txt and commit proof artifacts — done

Notes:
- Earlier single-line PowerShell failed due to quoting and gitignore interaction. The commit_proofs.ps1 script avoids those issues and can be re-used.
- Your branch is ahead of origin by 43 commits; I did not push per policy.

Next steps:
- Do you want me to push the commit to origin/feature/loggerdb-cli?
- Any additional orchestration steps to run or changes to dev/find_and_start_chat.ps1 or ecosys_boot.ps1?
